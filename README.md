# wrap-your-own-spotify
analyzes your spotify data

## how to use
step one, download your extended spotify data, you can request that at [here](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/)
step two, unzip your spotify data
step three, place the four python files in the same directory as the "MyData" folder from the zip file
step four, run wrap_my_spotify.py
step five, judge past you for your music choices

## dependancies and stuff
tested on python 3.11.1, probably works on 3.11.0, uses typing.Self so remove that annotation from instance.py and you should be good to go on 3.10 and maybe lower
uses tqdm 4.61.1 and colorama 0.4.6
